### Data Source ️

VG Sales Data: The dataset used for this analysis is the "vgsales.csv" file, containing detailed information about the global and regional sales of various video games overtime.

### Tools 

- Microsoft Excel


### Data Cleaning & Preparation 

In the data cleaning and preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis 

EDA involved exploring the video game sales data to answer key questions such as:

- Who are the Top 10 Publishers by sales?
- What are the TOP 10 Genres by sales?
- What is the distribution of Sales by Region?
- What is the distribution of Regional Sales by Genre?
- What is the overall Video Game Releases trend?

### Results/Findings 

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. A majority of the total video game sales is generated in North America.
2. The Top 10 Publishers by sales constitute about 70% of total sales and the Top 10 Genres by sales contribute to about 96% of total sales.
3. The most video games were released between 2010 and 2014.

### Limitations 

I had to remove some rows of data with missing values because it could have affected the accuracy of my analysis.
